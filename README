Still got some not totally working funcitons, as delete specific lines.
But almost perfectly works the way I wanted it to.
We don't talk about the messy code ty.
If you got improvements and want to fix the delete specific lines function go ahead. :)

To open already existing files follow these steps:

1: Go to Select Log File (Input: 0)
2: Go to Select existing log file (Input: 1)
3: Now Enter the Path of you file Example: C:\Users\"YOUR USER"\source\repos\LogWriter\x64\Release\"YOUR FILENAME".txt
Obviously only works with .txt files!
